# GrassCutterPlusPlus
A C++ reimplementation of a Java emulator for a certain anime game

## Requirements
Mandatory :
- CryptoPP (8.7) library
- JsonCpp (1.9.5)
- Boost (1.81) library 
- MongoCXX (3.7) library

Build the libs that suit your system configuration and put them into a "library" folder along with the present "include" folder.
I will later add CMake files to generate a user-specific SLN.
